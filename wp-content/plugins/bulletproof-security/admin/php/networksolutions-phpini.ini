[Security and Performance Directives]

[The disable_functions php.ini Directive disables php functions from running on your php server / website]
[Functions Currently Disabled: system, exec, passthru, shell_exec, show_source, popen, pclose, pcntl_exec]
[Using a recommended function in the disable_functions directive may cause one or more of your plugins to break / not work]
[If you add additional functions to the disable_functions directive check your php Error Log for errors]
[If any of your WP plugins are using any of these disabled PHP functions you will see an error in your php error log]
[Example php error log Warning: show_source() has been disabled for security reasons]
[Use the BPS String Finder Tool to search for php functions that your plugins may be using before adding them to disable_functions] 
[For Virtual or Dedicated hosting use the Suhosin-Extension instead and comment out disable_functions below with a semi-colon]
