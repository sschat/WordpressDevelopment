[This file should be named "phprc" without a file extension and be saved here /.php/5.3/phprc]
[If your prefer to use your DreamHost master host php.ini file instead of creating a custom php.ini file...]
[...you can add the path to the BPS protected php error log file to your DH master php.ini file instead] 

[For DreamHost setup instructions and reference see the AITpro php.ini help doc listed below]

[If a directive is commented out or the value is not specified then the directive will use your system default settings]
[If your host does not allow you to change certain Directives in your custom php.ini file then you will not see any changes...]
[...when you view phpinfo to see your PHP server configuration settings. Changes to your php.ini file could take up to 15 minutes to be seen...]
[...or go into effect, but usually will not take more than 5 minutes for your changes to take effect.]

[Security and Performance Directives]

[If the Suhosin-Extension is enabled on your server then do not use the disable_functions directive below]
[See the Help Resource1 link for the difference between the Suhosin-Patch and the Suhosin-Extension and more info about Suhosin]
[The disable_functions php.ini Directive disables php functions from running on your php server / website]
[Functions Currently Disabled: system, exec, passthru, shell_exec, show_source, popen, pclose, pcntl_exec]
[Using a recommended function in the disable_functions directive may cause one or more of your plugins to break / not work]
[If you add additional functions to the disable_functions directive check your php Error Log for errors]
[If any of your WP plugins are using any of these disabled PHP functions you will see an error in your php error log]
[Example php error log Warning: show_source() has been disabled for security reasons]
[Use the BPS String Finder Tool to search for php functions that your plugins may be using before adding them to disable_functions]
