[Security and Performance Directives]

[If the Suhosin-Extension is enabled on your server then do not use the disable_functions directive below]

[If any of your WP plugins are using any of these disabled PHP functions you will see an error in your php error log]
[Example php error log Warning: show_source() has been disabled for security reasons]
[Use the BPS String Finder Tool to search for php functions that your plugins may be using before adding them to disable_functions]
